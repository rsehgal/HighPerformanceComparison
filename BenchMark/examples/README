Tests directory contains 4 benchMark Program
denseVectorAddition.cpp : BenchMarking the addition of Vector. In this program the data is store in array of double.
heapTestVectorAddition.cpp : This will also BenchMark the addition of Vector. But the data is store in a heap created by overloaded new of Vector3DFast
			     heap of blaze

matrixVector.cpp : BenchMarking the (Matrix X Vector) operation. The data is again in double array
heapTestMatrixVector.cpp : This will also do BenchMarking of (Matrix X Vector) operation. But the data is store in a heap created by overloaded new ofi     				 Vector3DFast heap of blaze

daxpy.cpp : BenchMarking the (c = b + a*scalar) operation. The data is again in double array
heapTestDaxpy.cpp : This will also do BenchMarking of (c = b + a*scalar) operation. But the data is store in a heap created by overloaded new of                                   Vector3DFast heap of blaze
